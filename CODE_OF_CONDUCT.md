# Community guidelines

Be fair, and work cooperatively. This is a open source project where contributions are welcome from anyone with an interest in MS-DOS and emulation.

Leave your politics at the door. All that matters here is DOSBox-X, emulation, games, software, hardware, accuracy, code, development, and documentation. Anything else is off-topic and will be treated as such.

I will block users that are hostile to this project, it's developers, and/or users with an explicit explanation as to why. That includes threats, slander, damaging gossip, doxxing, and spreading misinformation about myself and contributors to this project whether here or anywhere else, on the internet or in real life.

Humor and jokes are welcome as long as they are on-topic.
